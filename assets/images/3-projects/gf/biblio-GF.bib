abstract = {Purpose: A low-cost, open source, self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) has been developed, which greatly expands the potential user base of rapid prototypers. The operating cost of the RepRap can be further reduced using waste polymers as feedstock. Centralized recycling of polymers is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. This paper provides a proof of concept for high-value recycling of waste polymers at distributed creation sites. Approach: Previous designs of waste plastic extruders (also known as RecycleBots) were evaluated using a weighted evaluation matrix. An updated design was completed and the description and analysis of the design is presented including component summary, testing procedures, a basic life cycle analysis and extrusion results. The filament was tested for consistency of density and diameter while quantifying electricity consumption. Findings: Filament was successfully extruded at an average rate of 90 mm/min and used to print parts. The filament averaged 2.805mm diameter with 87{\%} of samples between 2.540mm and 3.081mm. The average mass was 0.564 g/100mm length. Energy use was 0.06 kWh/m. Originality: This paper reports on the first technical evaluation of a feedstock filament for the RepRap from waste plastic material made in a distributed recycling device. Practical Implications: The success of the RecycleBot further reduces RepRap operating costs, which enables distributed in-home, value added, plastic recycling. This has implications for municipal waste management programs as in-home recycling could reduce cost and greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste collection and transportation as well as the environmental impact of manufacturing custom plastic parts},

abstract = {The growth of desktop 3-D printers is driving an interest in recycled 3-D printer filament to reduce costs of distributed production. Life cycle analysis studies were performed on the recycling of high density polyethylene into filament suitable for additive layer manufacturing with 3-D printers. The conventional centralized recycling system for high population density and low population density rural locations was compared to the proposed in home, distributed recycling system. This system would involve shredding and then producing filament with an open-source plastic extruder from post-consumer plastics and then printing the extruded filament into usable, value-added parts and products with 3-D printers such as the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper, or RepRap. The embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated for high density polyethylene recycling using SimaPro 7.2 and the database EcoInvent v2.0. The results showed that distributed recycling uses less embodied energy than the best- case scenario used for centralized recycling. For centralized recycling in a low-density population case study involving substantial embodied energy use for transportation and collection these savings for distributed recycling were found to extend to over 80{\%}. If the distributed process is applied to the U.S. high density polyethylene currently recycled, more than 100 million MJ of energy could be conserved per annum along with the concomitant significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It is concluded that with the open-source 3-D printing network expanding rapidly the potential for widespread adop- tion of in-home recycling of post-consumer plastic represents a novel path to a future of distributed manufacturing appropriate for both the developed and developing world with lower environmental impacts than the current system},

Conclusion
Distributed recycling of post-consumer HDPE for 3D printing filament uses less embodied energy (Reduction up to 80{\%} in transportation and collection) than the best-case scenario investigated for a high-population density using centralized recycling.},

@article{Anzalone2013,
abstract = {Although the environmental benefits of recycling plastics are well established and most geographic locations within the U.S. offer some plastic recycling, recycling rates are often low. Low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants due to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight polymers. The recycling rates decline further when low population density, rural and relatively isolated communities are investigated because of the distance to recycling centers makes recycling difficult and both economically and energetically inefficient. The recent development of a class of open source hardware tools (e.g. RecycleBots) able to convert post-consumer plastic waste to polymer filament for 3-D printing offer a means to increase recycling rates by enabling distributed recycling. In addition, to reducing the amount of plastic disposed of in landfills, distributed recycling may also provide low-income families a means to supplement their income with domestic production of small plastic goods. This study investigates the environmental impacts of polymer recycling. A life-cycle analysis (LCA) for centralized plastic recycling is compared to the implementation of distributed recycling in rural areas. Environmental impact of both recycling scenarios is quantified in terms of energy use per unit mass of recycled plastic. A sensitivity analysis is used to determine the environmental impacts of both systems as a function of distance to recycling centers. The results of this LCA study indicate that distributed recycling of HDPE for rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes. This study indicates that the technical progress in solar photovoltaic devices, open-source 3-D printing and polymer filament extrusion have made distributed polymer recycling and upcycling technically viable.},

abstract = {Following the rapid rise of distributed additive manufacturing with 3-D printing has come the technical development of filament extruders and recyclebots, which can turn both virgin polymer pellets and post-consumer shredded plastic into 3-D filament. Similar to the solutions proposed for other forms of ethical manufacturing, it is possible to consider a form of ethical 3-D printer filament distribution being developed. There is a market opportunity for producing this ethical 3-D printer filament, which is addressed in this paper by developing an “ethical product standard” for 3-D filament based upon a combination of existing fair-trade standards and technical and life cycle analysis of recycled filament production and 3-D printing manufacturing. These standards apply to businesses that can enable the economic development of waste pickers and include i) minimum pricing, ii) fair trade premium, iii) labor standards, iv) environmental and technical standards, v) health and safety standards, and vi) social standards including those that cover discrimination, harassment, freedom of association, collective bargaining and discipline.},

@article{Despeisse2016,
abstract = {The circular economy (CE) aims to radically improve resource efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following overarching questions to discover what specific issues they entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows? (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We specifically examine six areas-design, supply chains, information flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education-with the aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its full potential for a CE.},

@article{CruzSanchez2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability.},

abstract = {With the 26{\%} annual growth rate of additive manufacturing, especially
in the area of 3D polymer printing, the amount of waste is increasing at
a rapid rate. Limited research in the area of recycling has been
produced, yet there are several recycling machines being developed for
home use. Despite this work there is no published mechanical data on
components produced with filament recycled from 3D printed parts. There
is very limited data on mechanical properties of any 3D printed
materials. This article compares the properties of parts 3D printed with
virgin polylactic acid (PLA) to those printed with recycled PLA. Using
commercially available PLA and an entry level 3D printer, tensile and
shear specimens were produced and then tested for tensile yield
strength, modulus of elasticity, shear yield strength, and hardness. The
specimens were then ground up and re-extruded into filament, and a
second set of specimens were produced and tested using this recycled PLA
filament. Mechanical testing showed that 3D printing with recycled PLA
is a viable option. With the recycled filament, tensile strength
decreased 10.9{\%}, shear strength increased 6.8{\%}, and hardness decreased
2.4{\%}. The tensile modulus of elasticity was statistically unchanged.
Although the average mechanical properties before and after recycling
were similar, there was more variability in the results of the recycled
filament. Additionally, when printing with the recycled filament there
was some nozzle clogging, while none occurred with the virgin filament.
Overall, the mechanical properties of specimens 3D printed from recycled
PLA filament were similar to virgin properties, encouraging further
development in the area of recycling 3D printed filament.},

@article{Zander2018,
abstract = {Reclaimed materials such as waste plastics can be utilized in additive manufacturing to improve the self-reliance of warfighters on forward operating bases by cutting costs and decreasing the demand for the frequent resupplying of parts by the supply chain. In addition, the use of waste materials in additive manufacturing in the private sector would reduce cost and increase sustainability, providing a high-value output for used plastics. Experimentation is conducted to process polyethylene terephthalate bottles and packaging into filament that can then be used for additive manufacturing methods like fused filament fabrication, without the use of additives or modification to the polymer. The chemistry of different polyethylene terephthalate recycled feedstocks was evaluated and found to be identical, and thus mixed feedstock processing is a suitable approach. Rheological data showed drying of the recycled polyethylene terephthalate led to an increase in the polymer's viscosity. Thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated for filament with different processing conditions, as well as printed and molded specimens. Crystallinity ranged from 12.2 for the water cooled filament, compared to 24.9{\%} for the filament without any active cooling. Tensile results show that the elongation to failure was similar to an injection molded part (3.5{\%}) and tensile strength of 35.1 ± 8 MPa was comparable to commercial polycarbonate-ABS filament, demonstrating the robustness of the material. In addition, three point bending tests showed a similar load at failure for a select long-lead military part printed from the recycled filament compared to parts printed from commercial filament. Thus filament from recycled polyethylene terephthalate has the capability for replacing commercial filament in printing a diverse range of plastic parts.},

@article{Sauerwein2018,
abstract = {The potential of additive manufacturing (AM) for distributed production is often mentioned as an enabler for sustainable manufacturing within a circular economy. Currently, even if manufacturing with AM is distributed, the used materials can rarely be acquired locally and are usually obtained from a centralized location. Addressing this issue, we are developing an approach that supports the search for local materials that are suitable as material input for AM and are recyclable to serve multiple product lifecycles. The approach is an iterative process consisting of four phases; “material in AM context”, “recycling opportunities”, “material property testing”, and “application possibilities”. As an initial example, we present a process to adapt mussel shell waste into AM material. Mussel shells are a voluminous waste stream in the Netherlands. The shells, which mainly exist of calcium carbonate, are ground into a powder and combined with sugar water. Using a modified material extrusion process, 3D objects are created. In this paper, we discuss the iterations through our approach and illustrate the initial 3D printed results. With this project, we intend to demonstrate the potential of using local waste streams for AM processes for a circular economy. This is a first step towards the development of a methodology for linking local material streams to novel AM processes and meaningful applications.},

@article{Hart2018,
abstract = {Millions of Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) are consumed annually by soldiers around the world. This results in the generation of thousands of tons of residual polymeric packaging waste, which is either left behind in the environment or otherwise recycled or incinerated at a cost of several millions of U.S. dollars per year. Advancements in distributed recycling technologies now allow for on-demand reconstitution of traditionally neglected MRE pouch waste into useful appliances via material extrusion additive manufacturing. In this work, we demonstrate recycling of MRE pouch materials through a combined compounding, filament extrusion, and fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing protocol. Mechanical properties and barrier properties of additively manufactured structures were evaluated through tensile testing and water vapor transmission testing, respectively, and found to be comparable to the native pouch materials. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis of the extruded filament and printed materials were contrasted with native pouch materials, showing minimal effects of the manufacturing process on critical thermal transitions in the polymer. Economics and viability of on-demand reconstitution using these proposed methods are briefly discussed and reveal the multiple benefits of this recycling process.},

    abstract = { Abstract This research addresses the grave issue of plastic waste in the Pacific. By using Samoa as a case study, it was considered that distributed recycling combined with 3D printing offers an opportunity to (1) repurpose and add new value to this difficult waste stream and (2) engage diverse local communities in Samoa by combining notions of participatory design with traditional Samoan social concepts. Fieldwork in Samoa established the scope of the issue through interviews with stakeholders in government, waste management businesses, the arts and crafts community and education. Based on the information obtained from the fieldwork, potential product areas and designs were explored through material and 3D printing experiments using low-cost, open-source equipment. The experiments informed the design of speculative scenarios for workable, economically viable, socially empowering and sustainable systems for repurposing and upcycling plastic waste, which then enabled production of practically useful and culturally meaningful 3D printed objects, artefacts and products. Building upon the outcome and with a view towards implementation, Creative Pathways, an educational initiative aimed at propagating 3D printing and contextual design, was established and is being delivered in local schools. }
