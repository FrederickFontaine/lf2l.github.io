abstract = {The 2020 toy and game market is projected to be US{\$}135 billion. To determine if 3D printing could affect these markets if consumers offset purchases by 3D printing free designs, this study investigates the 100 most popular downloaded designs at MyMiniFactory in a month. Savings are quantified for using a Lulzbot Mini 3D printer and three filament types: commercial filament, pellet-extruded filament, and post-consumer waste converted to filament with a recyclebot. Case studies probed the quality of: (1) six common complex toys; (2) Lego blocks; and (3) the customizability of open source board games. All filaments analyzed saved the user over 75{\%} of the cost of commercially available true alternative toys and over 90{\%} for recyclebot filament. Overall, these results indicate a single 3D printing repository among dozens is saving consumers well over {\$}60 million/year in offset purchases. The most common savings fell by 40{\%}–90{\%} in total savings, which came with the ability to make novel toys and games. The results of this study show consumers can generate higher value items for less money using the open source distributed manufacturing paradigm. It appears clear that consumer do-it-yourself (DIY) manufacturing is set to have a significant impact on the toy and game markets in the future.},

abstract = {A cleaner production pattern for high-performance continuous carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) has been proposed on the base of recycling and remanufacturing of 3D printed continuous carbon fiber reinforced (CFR) PLA composites. Continuous carbon fiber and PLA matrix was recycled in the form of PLA impregnated carbon fiber filament from 3D printed composite components and reused as the raw material for further 3D printing process. The original printing trajectory is reversely applied, allowing for a 100{\%} recycling of the continuous fiber without any effect on the mechanical properties. Tensile performance of recycled carbon fiber filaments was evaluated, which was higher than that of originally printed composites. Remanufactured CFRTPCs specimens also exhibited a 25{\%} higher bending strength than that of original ones, which experimentally demonstrated the first non-downgrade recycling process for CFRTPCs. A material recovery rate of 100{\%} for continuous carbon fiber and 73{\%} for PLA matrix were achieved for a better environmental impact. Energy consumption of 67.7 and 66 MJ/kg respectively for recycling and remanufacturing processes was detected and compared with conventional methods. The proposed cleaner production pattern offered a potential strategy for the low-cost industrial application of fully recyclable composites.},

@article{Clayton2015,
abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is sensitive to powder variability when applying fine layers in a uniform manner. This demands a high degree of consistency and repeatability in the feedstock. Particle size is often used as a critical quality attribute, but this is not sufficient to fully qualify a feedstock. Indeed, it is inadequate to suggest that any parameter from a single test, e.g., Hall flowmeter or Hausner ratio, can comprehensively describe a powder's characteristics. This article uses four case studies to demonstrate the limitations of single parameter characterization and how the rheological properties of several metal powders used in AM applications are used to establish in-process performance. In the first study, the significantly reduced permeability and increased specific energy of a one batch of powder demonstrate a clear link to poor layer uniformity. The second study investigates the impact of metal powder manufacturing methods and suppliers, and it shows how shear properties alone cannot be relied on to identify properties that influence the process. The effect of additives on the processability of polymer blends used in AM is also evaluated, and the results show that even small quantities can have a significant effect on the permeability and basic flowability energy of feedstocks. The final study demonstrates the how rheological measurements can be used to identify the optimum blend of fresh and used material when reusing metal powders to manufacture components. These case studies illustrate the ability of a modern powder rheometer to detect minor variations in powders that are directly relevant to performance in AM processes in a way that traditional characterization methods cannot. {\textcopyright} 2015, The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Polymer laser sintering (LS) is an important additive manufacturing (AM) technology. Individual and complex parts are directly produced from CAD data without the need of specific tools. The raw material is a polymer powder, which is deposited layerwise and melted selectively with a laser. Built parts are embedded in residual unmolten powder, the so-called part cake, which undergoes thermal ageing effects due to the exposure to high temperatures for long times during the manufacturing process. Hence, the recyclability of the unmolten powder is limited. This article focuses on a fundamental analysis of the ageing kinetics dependent on time, temperature, and oxygen content in the gas atmosphere. A model is developed and applied to measured, position-dependent process temperature histories to successfully predict the ageing distribution within a part cake. The results can be used to optimize the thermal process management in LS and to develop new efficient powder recycling methods.},

@article{Whyman2018,
abstract = {The extrusion system is an integral part of any fused deposition style 3D printing technique. However, the extruder designs found in commercial and hobbyist printers are mostly suitable for materials in filament form. While printing with a filament is not a problem per se, the printing of materials that may not be readily available in the filament form or not commercially viable remains untapped, e.g., biopolymers and material blends. This is particularly an issue in the research and hobbyist space where the capability of printing a variety of materials or materials recycled from already printed parts may be of utmost importance. This paper presents a pellet-based extrusion system for the 3D printing of biopolymers. The system has been designed from the first principles and therefore can be extended to other materials with parameter adjustments or slight hardware modifications. A robust mechatronic design has been realized using an unconventional yet simplistic approach. The extrusion system uses a series of control factors to generate a consistent output of material over the course of a print. The platform and surrounding processes are set up so that software can be used to define the printing parameters; this allows a simpler adaption to different materials. The utility of the extruder is demonstrated through extensive printing and testing of the printed parts.},

abstract = {Production and maker spaces are increasingly generating mixed plastic material waste of varying quality from 3-D printers. Industrial interest is growing in embedding granulated recycled particulate material additives into a virgin binding matrix. Examples include the introduction of granulated mixed recycled materials into 3-D printer material, concrete, and pavement. The stress load-sharing between the particulate additive and the binding matrix is an important factor in design and development of these composite materials. With mixed material additives, a designer is interested in the variation of such predicted load-sharing. However, experimental development is costly and time-consuming, thus analytical and semi-analytical estimates are desired for accelerated development. In this work, we expand on previous analytically correlated phase-averaged micro- and macrostructural loading to include variational effects present in mixed recycled material. In addition, model trade-offs are provided to aid designers in quickly selecting application specific mixtures. This framework identifies the stress contributions, and their variation, to reduce product development time and costs, which could greatly accelerate material recycling and reuse for improved infrastructure materials, low-cost 3-D printer filament, and reduced waste towards a more circular economy.},

This results in the generation of thousands of tons of residual polymeric packaging waste, which is either left behind in the environment or otherwise recycled or incinerated at a cost of several millions of U.S. dollars per year. Advancements in distributed recycling technologies now allow for on-demand reconstitution of traditionally neglected MRE pouch waste into useful appliances via material extrusion additive manufacturing. In this work, we demonstrate recycling of MRE pouch materials through a combined compounding, filament extrusion, and fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing protocol. Mechanical properties and barrier properties of additively manufactured structures were evaluated through tensile testing and water vapor transmission testing, respectively, and found to be comparable to the native pouch materials. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis of the extruded filament and printed materials were contrasted with native pouch materials, showing minimal effects of the manufacturing process on critical thermal transitions in the polymer. Economics and viability of on-demand reconstitution using these proposed methods are briefly discussed and reveal the multiple benefits of this recycling process.},

In the present research work, nylon-6 waste (collected from local plastic based industry) has been recycled, through extrusion process, in the form of fused deposition modelling (FDM) feedstock filament. This alternatively developed FDM filament has been successfully used to fabricate sacrificial patterns for investment casting process (ICP). The process was started with investigating the melt flow index (MFI) of collected nylon-6 waste which was matched with the commercial FDM filament through reinforcement. Finally, single screw extruder of has been used for the development of FDM filament proportion with a mixture of 60{\%} nylon-6, 30{\%} Al and 30{\%} Al2O3 (by wt.). The resulting FDM patterns have been used in ICP for development of aluminum matrix composite (AMC). Taguchi L9 was used to investigate the affect of process parameters (volume of pattern, density of pattern and number of IC coatings) on dimensional accuracy of AMC developed. Apart from suggesting an alternative method for management and recycling of nylon-6 waste, the present research work also described a new approach for the development of AMC with tailor made properties.},

In addition, novel robotic fabrication processes are developed and evaluated, such as multi-axis plastic 3D printing, direct recycling 3D printing, and embedded printing.

The printed PEF objects created in the present study show higher chemical resistance than objects printed with commonly available materials (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETG)). The studied PEF polymer has shown key advantages for 3D printing: optimal adhesion, thermoplasticity, lack of delamination and low heat shrinkage. The high thermal stability of PEF and relatively low temperature that is necessary for extrusion are optimal for recycling printed objects and minimizing waste. Several successive cycles of 3D printing and recycling were successfully shown. The suggested approach for extending additive manufacturing to carbon-neutral materials opens a new direction in the field of sustainable development.},

abstract = {Concerning individualization, the requirements to products have increased. Additive manufacturing technologies, such as selective laser melting allow manufacturing of complex parts without tools and forms. Due to this additive manufacturing processes comply, in opposite to conventional techniques, with these increased demands on processing technology. Due to the high temperature during processing, a degradation of the used plastic powder occurs. The non-molten material in the building chamber, the so-called partcake, can be removed after building from the finished component and reused for another process. To realize reproducible part properties refreshing of partcake powder with 30 up to 50 {\%} virgin powder is necessary. However, these refreshing strategies lead to varying component properties due to an undefined aging state. Previous investigations on oven aged powder for selective laser melting showed for short periods of storage near the melting point thermally induced post condensation is the predominate aging effect. Due to post condensation the molecular weight and thus the viscosity increases. This paper focuses on the modeling of the post condensation process to define the aging state of polyamide 12 powder in laser melting process. Therefore the rheological behavior of PA 12 powder in dependency of time and temperature is investigated. Isothermal viscosity measurements are conducted in order to describe the post condensation$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreaction with a model. With knowledge of the kinetics of the post condensation$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreaction the state of aging can be predicted in a second step. Thus expected useful life of the powder can be calculated in dependency of the building chamber temperature. These results are then compared with viscosity values of defined aged PA 12 powder to validate the determined model.},

abstract = {In this study, involving additive manufacturing (AM) using electron beam melting (EBM), we have examined build defects which result from beam tripping, porosities (including unmelted or unsintered zones) due to excursions from optimal build parameters (especially variations in melt scan beam current and scan speed), and gas bubbles trapped in atomized Ti-6Al-4V starting powder as well as recycled powder, and retained in the build. At optimized build conditions we have also examined microstructure-mechanical property (hardness, tensile strength, and elongation) variations for multiple rake building and multiple melt scans using optical metallography and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). These build variances cause cooling rate variances which promote $\alpha$-phase growth and variations in dislocation density, as well as $\alpha$-to-$\alpha$′ (martensite) phase changes, all of which produce some degree of mechanical property variations. These features (especially $\alpha$-to-$\alpha$' phase changes) are notable on comparing solid builds in comparison with a variety of mesh arrays where strut dimension and build-element complexities alter the cooling rates in a significant way. We illustrate these microstructure variations with corresponding variations in microindentation hardness measurements made directly on fine mesh (strut) structures. Finally, we have examined Ti-6Al-4V powder chemistries and solid build chemistries which for single-pass melt scans at optimized build conditions are shown to be relatively constant up to 40 cycles of powder reuse with the exception of Al content which was reduced by 10 to 15{\%} in solid builds at optimized conditions. However, Al loss in solid builds approached 25{\%} for multiple (2 and 3) melt scans, while no changes in Ar gas-bubble density were observed with changes in $\alpha$-phase (grain) width which increased from 3 $\mu$m for a single melt scan to 4.5 and 6 $\mu$m for 2 and 3 melt scans, respectively. Corresponding Rockwell C-scale (HRC) hardness varied from 37, 36, and 35, respectively; with ultimate tensile strengths exceeding 1.2 GPa at elongations of 12{\%} or higher for this melt scan sequence.},

In addition, tensile samples were manufactured and evaluated with respect to powder reuse times and sample locations in the powder bed. The following findings were made from reusing the same batch of powder 21 times for AM by selective electron beam melting: (i) the oxygen (O) content increased progressively with increasing reuse times but both the Al content and the V content remained generally stable (a small decrease only); (ii) the powder became less spherical with increasing reuse times and some particles showed noticeable distortion and rough surfaces after being reused 16 times; (iii) the PSD became narrower and few satellite particles were observed after 11 times of reuse; (iv) reused powder showed improved flowability; and (v) reused powder showed no measurable undesired influence on the AM process and the samples exhibited highly consistent tensile properties, irrespective of their locations in the powder bed.

abstract = {Although the environmental benefits of recycling plastics are well established and most geographic locations within the U.S. offer some plastic recycling, recycling rates are often low. Low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants due to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight polymers. The recycling rates decline further when low population density, rural and relatively isolated communities are investigated because of the distance to recycling centers makes recycling difficult and both economically and energetically inefficient. The recent development of a class of open source hardware tools (e.g. RecycleBots) able to convert post-consumer plastic waste to polymer filament for 3-D printing offer a means to increase recycling rates by enabling distributed recycling. In addition, to reducing the amount of plastic disposed of in landfills, distributed recycling may also provide low-income families a means to supplement their income with domestic production of small plastic goods. This study investigates the environmental impacts of polymer recycling. A life-cycle analysis (LCA) for centralized plastic recycling is compared to the implementation of distributed recycling in rural areas. Environmental impact of both recycling scenarios is quantified in terms of energy use per unit mass of recycled plastic. A sensitivity analysis is used to determine the environmental impacts of both systems as a function of distance to recycling centers. The results of this LCA study indicate that distributed recycling of HDPE for rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes. This study indicates that the technical progress in solar photovoltaic devices, open-source 3-D printing and polymer filament extrusion have made distributed polymer recycling and upcycling technically viable.},

The characterization of these powders is important in NIST efforts to develop appropriate measurements and standards for additive materials and to document the property of powders used in a NIST-led additive manufacturing material round robin. An extensive array of characterization techniques was applied to these two powders, in both virgin and recycled states. The physical techniques included laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray computed tomography for size and shape analysis, and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Techniques sensitive to chemistry, including X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive analytical X-ray analysis using the X-rays generated during scanning electron microscopy, were also employed.

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the polyamide 12 (PA12) powder properties deterioration in the laser sintering (LS) process and propose a methodology for more efficient powder recycling. The main goals are: to recommend a level of input PA2200 powder properties which could guarantee acceptable part quality in the LS process; and selection of the refresh rate in order to minimise the consumption of fresh material. Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses the LS processing conditions and current recycling practices in relation to the deterioration or ageing of the PA12-based powders. Samples of new and recycled grades of PA2200 powder were artificially aged in a temperature-controlled oven and then tested using melt flow rate (MFR) indexer. Also, un-sintered powder samples collected from different locations within various builds, and different LS machines (EOSINT P700 and SinterstationUP/UP 2500 HiQ) were tested. Findings - The powder exposed at higher temperature and longer time experiences a much higher deterioration rate. The temperature and the time at which the un-sintered material was exposed are the most influential parameters for the powder aging. It was confirmed that the MFR index is a very sensitive indicator of the changes in the powder properties and provides a relatively fast and inexpensive method of measuring the rate of the powder degradation because of the LS process. The powder located in the periphery and the top of a build has a higher MFR and therefore is less deteriorated. In contrast, powder located in the centre, or in the bottom of a long build has much lower MFR and therefore is less usable. Practical implications - Based on the findings, a methodology for powder recycling is proposed. It allows a better control of the input material properties, a consistent quality of the fabricated parts, and more efficient use of the LS material. Originality/value - The paper provides some useful information for the properties deterioration of PA12-based powders (PA2200) in relation to the temperature and time at which the material is exposed in the LS. {\textcopyright} 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {A promising method of enhancing the circular economy is distributed plastic recycling. In this study plastic waste is upcycled into 3-D printing filament with a recyclebot, which is an open source waste plastic extruder. The recyclebot is combined with an open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer, to enable post-consumer ABS plastic filament from computer waste to be further upcycled into valuable consumer products pre-designed in the digital commons. The total electrical energy consumption for the combined process is monitored and an economic evaluation is completed. The coupled distributed recycling and manufacturing method for complex products reduces embodied energy by half, while reducing the cost of consumer products to pennies. This economic benefit provides an incentive for consumers to both home recycle and home manufacture, which tightens the loop on the circular economy by eliminating waste associated from transportation and retail. It is clear from the results that waste plastic can be significantly upcycled at the individual level using this commons-based approach. This tightening of the loop of the circular economy benefits the environment and sustainability as well as the economic stability of consumers/prosumers.},

The present study describes fully renewable thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) consisting of synthesized biobased elastomer (PLBSI) and poly (lactic acid) (PLA) by in situ dynamic vulcanization for 3D-printed materials. The morphology study implied in situ dynamic vulcanization and phase inversion occurs and leads the PLBSI elastomer dispersed as microparticles in PLA matrix. Then, the morphological evolution mechanism was proposed and indicated the dispersed PLBSI elastomer microparticles are actually agglomerates of elastomer nanoparticles. The PLBSI/PLA TPVs perform good processability and reprocessability by rheological and recyclability tests. Besides, good in vitro degradability and cytotoxicity suggests PLBSI/PLA TPVs are promising sustainable biomaterials. The superior strength and elasticity confirmed by the tensile tests of 3D-printed samples, and firm microstructure and the reliable printed accuracy of 3D-printed samples investigated by SEM implied the PLBSI/PLA TPVs were ideal 3D-printing materials.},

abstract = {The growth of desktop 3-D printers is driving an interest in recycled 3-D printer filament to reduce costs of distributed production. Life cycle analysis studies were performed on the recycling of high density polyethylene into filament suitable for additive layer manufacturing with 3-D printers. The conventional centralized recycling system for high population density and low population density rural locations was compared to the proposed in home, distributed recycling system. This system would involve shredding and then producing filament with an open-source plastic extruder from post-consumer plastics and then printing the extruded filament into usable, value-added parts and products with 3-D printers such as the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper, or RepRap. The embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated for high density polyethylene recycling using SimaPro 7.2 and the database EcoInvent v2.0. The results showed that distributed recycling uses less embodied energy than the best- case scenario used for centralized recycling. For centralized recycling in a low-density population case study involving substantial embodied energy use for transportation and collection these savings for distributed recycling were found to extend to over 80{\%}. If the distributed process is applied to the U.S. high density polyethylene currently recycled, more than 100 million MJ of energy could be conserved per annum along with the concomitant significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It is concluded that with the open-source 3-D printing network expanding rapidly the potential for widespread adop- tion of in-home recycling of post-consumer plastic represents a novel path to a future of distributed manufacturing appropriate for both the developed and developing world with lower environmental impacts than the current system},

abstract = {Purpose: A low-cost, open source, self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) has been developed, which greatly expands the potential user base of rapid prototypers. The operating cost of the RepRap can be further reduced using waste polymers as feedstock. Centralized recycling of polymers is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. This paper provides a proof of concept for high-value recycling of waste polymers at distributed creation sites. Approach: Previous designs of waste plastic extruders (also known as RecycleBots) were evaluated using a weighted evaluation matrix. An updated design was completed and the description and analysis of the design is presented including component summary, testing procedures, a basic life cycle analysis and extrusion results. The filament was tested for consistency of density and diameter while quantifying electricity consumption. Findings: Filament was successfully extruded at an average rate of 90 mm/min and used to print parts. The filament averaged 2.805mm diameter with 87{\%} of samples between 2.540mm and 3.081mm. The average mass was 0.564 g/100mm length. Energy use was 0.06 kWh/m. Originality: This paper reports on the first technical evaluation of a feedstock filament for the RepRap from waste plastic material made in a distributed recycling device. Practical Implications: The success of the RecycleBot further reduces RepRap operating costs, which enables distributed in-home, value added, plastic recycling. This has implications for municipal waste management programs as in-home recycling could reduce cost and greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste collection and transportation as well as the environmental impact of manufacturing custom plastic parts},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the ageing behaviour of acrylate-based resins for stereolithography (SL) technology using different test methods and to investigate these effects on polymers. Design/methodology/ approach - Controlling the polymer degradation requires an understanding of many different phenomena, including the different chemical mechanisms underlying structural changes in polymer macromolecules, the influences of polymer morphology, the complexities of oxidation chemistry and the complex reaction pathways of polymer additives. Several ageing characterization experiments are given. Findings - The paper covers the ageing process analysis of acrylate-based polymers. An overview of the ageing behaviour is given, along with the bandwidth of material characteristics for a prolonged lifetime of this material class. Research limitations/implications - For research and development in the field of rapid prototyping (RP) materials data about ageing behaviour and environmental effects are crucial. The authors show possible methods for measuring these effects and discuss the consequences in material research using a recently developed biocompatible SL resin as an example. Practical implications - The study of the ageing behaviour of polymers is important for understanding their usability, storage, lifetime and recycling. The presented polymeric formulations are able to meet the growing demand for both soft and stiff manufacturing resin materials in the engineering and medical fields. Originality/value - The analysis of the ageing behaviour of polymer materials is an important issue for engineering applications, recycling of post-consumer plastic waste, as well as the use of polymers as biological implants and matrices for drug delivery and the lifetime of an article. The paper gives an overview of details involving ageing behaviour and their meaning for applications of acrylate-based SL resins and is therefore of high importance to people with interest in long-term behaviour and ageing of RP materials},

The reduction of natural resource exploration and recovery of waste are examples of actions to contribute to a sustainable development. Waste from end-of-life tires and undifferentiated plastics represents an environmental problem due to the very high number of tons of used tires and plastics produced, but with a high economic potential because their incorporation into high value-added products is an issue of utmost importance. The manufacturing technologies oriented to the increase in quality levels, functional advantages, structural and financial gains of the produced products are currently a hot topic in industry. Similarly, the use of additive manufacturing technologies, instead of conventional techniques, e.g. moulding to process materials obtained from waste recovery, is a great industrial challenge. In order to promote greater environmental responsibility and to present innovative solutions for the management and sustainable destination of used waste recovery from tires and undifferentiated plastics, a composite made from the blend of 60{\%} of tire waste granulate and 40{\%} of polypropylene (PP) recycled was tested with the final purpose of generating components with added value. Both waste recovery materials were used in the micronized state. The thermal and mechanical behaviours of the synthesized composite were studied through DSC/TGA analysis and tensile testing. The implementation of additive manufacturing methodologies to process the blends between used tires granulated with a high incorporation of wastes from undifferentiated plastics was also explored in this work in order to produce big green parts without mould needed, such as urban furniture.},

It is common practice in industry to process a mix of recycled and virgin PA12 powder; however it is not yet fully understood how the Laser Sintering process parameters influence the microstructural composition for this mixture, namely the degree of crystallinity, the porosity characteristics and the distribution of the pores within the sintered parts. In this work X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is used to investigate the porosity of tensile bars printed flatwise using a 50/50 mix of used and virgin PA12 processed with different Laser Sintering energy densities (EDs). Analysis of the pores characteristics and image processing of the CT-slices parallel to the building platform provide insights into the link between Laser Sintering process parameters, pores formation and their arrangement into the sintered polymer for different energy density levels. This information combined with the crystallinity values measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry, gives a complete picture of the microstructure of the sintered material and its link with the resulting tensile properties.},

abstract = {Although additive layer manufacturing is well established for rapid prototyping the low throughput and historic costs have prevented mass-scale adoption. The recent development of the RepRap, an open source self-replicating rapid prototyper, has made low-cost 3-D printers readily available to the public at reasonable prices ({\textless}{\$}1,000). The RepRap (Prusa Mendell variant) currently prints 3-D objects in a 200x200x140 square millimeters build envelope from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). ABS and PLA are both thermoplastics that can be injection-molded, each with their own benefits, as ABS is rigid and durable, while PLA is plant-based and can be recycled and composted. The melting temperature of ABS and PLA enable use in low-cost 3-D printers, as these temperature are low enough to use in melt extrusion in the home, while high enough for prints to retain their shape at average use temperatures. Using 3-D printers to manufacture provides the ability to both change the fill composition by printing voids and fabricate shapes that are impossible to make using tradition methods like injection molding. This allows more complicated shapes to be created while using less material, which could reduce environmental impact. As the open source 3-D printers continue to evolve and improve in both cost and performance, the potential for economically-viable distributed manufacturing of products increases. Thus, products and components could be customized and printed on-site by individual consumers as needed, reversing the historical trend towards centrally mass-manufactured and shipped products. Distributed manufacturing reduces embodied transportation energy from the distribution of conventional centralized manufacturing, but questions remain concerning the potential for increases in the overall embodied energy of the manufacturing due to reduction in scale. In order to quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3-D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on a plastic juicer. The energy consumed and emissions produced from conventional large-scale production overseas are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap producing identical products with ABS and PLA. The results of this LCA are discussed in relation to the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing with 3-D printers and polymer selection for 3-D printing to reduce this impact. The results of this study show that distributed manufacturing uses less energy than conventional manufacturing due to the RepRap's unique ability to reduce fill composition. Distributed manufacturing also has less emissions than conventional manufacturing when using PLA and when using ABS with solar photovoltaic power. The results of this study indicate that open- source additive layer distributed manufacturing is both technically viable and beneficial from an ecological perspective.},

in the area of 3D polymer printing, the amount of waste is increasing at
a rapid rate. Limited research in the area of recycling has been

home use. Despite this work there is no published mechanical data on
components produced with filament recycled from 3D printed parts. There
is very limited data on mechanical properties of any 3D printed

virgin polylactic acid (PLA) to those printed with recycled PLA. Using
commercially available PLA and an entry level 3D printer, tensile and
shear specimens were produced and then tested for tensile yield
strength, modulus of elasticity, shear yield strength, and hardness. The
specimens were then ground up and re-extruded into filament, and a
second set of specimens were produced and tested using this recycled PLA
filament. Mechanical testing showed that 3D printing with recycled PLA
is a viable option. With the recycled filament, tensile strength
decreased 10.9{\%}, shear strength increased 6.8{\%}, and hardness decreased
2.4{\%}. The tensile modulus of elasticity was statistically unchanged.
Although the average mechanical properties before and after recycling
were similar, there was more variability in the results of the recycled
filament. Additionally, when printing with the recycled filament there
was some nozzle clogging, while none occurred with the virgin filament.
Overall, the mechanical properties of specimens 3D printed from recycled

The production of AM parts with consistent and predictable properties requires input materials (e.g., metal powders) with known and repeatable characteristics, which in turn requires standardized measurement methods for powder properties. First, based on our previous work, we assess the applicability of current standardized methods for powder characterization for metal AM powders. Then we present the results of systematic studies carried out on two different powder materials used for additive manufacturing: stainless steel and cobalt-chrome. The characterization of these powders is important in NIST efforts to develop appropriate measurements and standards for additive materials and to document the property of powders used in a NIST-led additive manufacturing material round robin. An extensive array of characterization techniques was applied to these two powders, in both virgin and recycled states. The physical techniques included laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray computed tomography for size and shape analysis, and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Techniques sensitive to structure and chemistry, including X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive analytical X-ray analysis using the X-rays generated during scanning electron microscopy, and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy were also employed. The results of these analyses show how virgin powder changes after being exposed to and recycled from one or more Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) additive manufacturing build cycles. In addition, these findings can give insight into the actual additive manufacturing process.},

However, once these thermosetting photopolymers form 3D parts through photopolymerization, the covalent networks are permanent and cannot be reprocessed, i.e., reshaped, repaired, or recycled. Here, we report a two-step polymerization strategy to develop 3D printing reprocessable thermosets (3DPRTs) that allow users to reform a printed 3D structure into a new arbitrary shape, repair a broken part by simply 3D printing new material on the damaged site, and recycle unwanted printed parts so the material can be reused for other applications. These 3DPRTs provide a practical solution to address environmental challenges associated with the rapid increase in consumption of 3D printing materials.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure the effect of process conditions on mechanical properties of laser-sintered nylon 12 (DuraformUP/UP) and to determine the range of conditions that provide consistent mechanical performance for additive manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach - Tensile test specimens were fabricated over a range of well-characterized process conditions including laser power, laser speed, scan spacing, layer thickness, build orientation, and build position. Tensile modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation-at-fracture were measured and related to process parameters. Findings - Tensile properties are strongly related to the amount of energy deposited during scanning. Strength and modulus approach their maximum values as the energy deposited exceeds the amount needed to fully melt the applied powder. Elongation-at-fracture does not reach its maximum until higher energy-melt ratio. Performance of blends with reused powder matches that of virgin powder when blend composition is adjusted to a standard melt-flow index. The volumetric energy density and the energy-melt ratio are useful for correlating mechanical properties with multiple process parameters and material thermal properties. Originality/value - This work presents the most extensive data to date on mechanical properties of nylon 12 (DuraformUP/UP) as they relate to the full range of process parameters. These data show that mechanical performance correlates strongly with the volume energy density. In contrast to the area energy density (a.k.a. Andrews Number), this volumetric parameter includes the effect of varying layer thickness and can be related directly to the melting characteristics of the polymer material. Within the parameter range studied, this relationship allows adjustment of one scan parameter for improved speed or dimensional accuracy while ensuring good strength by an offsetting adjustment of another parameter. Such trade-offs will be important in future manufacturing applications of the laser sintering process. Understanding the energy-melt ratio provides insight into the relationship between scan conditions and the physics of powder melting and sintering, and offers a methodology to relate results at other bed temperatures and with other polymer powders. {\&}copy; 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Given a task, a robot evolves a suitable morphology and control, then prints the assembled 3D structure, downloads into it and performs the task, and then recycles into a different form for the next task. This approach relinquishes the need to adhere to discrete or fixed components as well as manually designed configurations. Although the technology for fully realizing the proposed concept is not entirely available, we have demonstrated a first case: Given the task of locomotion, various robots with different mechanics and control are evolved automatically. The design space is comprised of only linear actuators and sigmoidal control neurons embodied in an arbitrary thermoplastic body. The robots then print pre-assembled using rapid prototyping technology, and perform the task in reality. The robots are then recycled. This paper described one implementation and provides examples of successful physical robots generated by the proposed process},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society This work focuses on developing filaments of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and their hollow particle-filled syntactic foams for commercial three-dimensional (3D) printers based on fused filament fabrication technology. Hollow fly-ash cenospheres were blended by 40 wt.{\%} in a HDPE matrix to produce syntactic foam (HDPE40) filaments. Further, the recycling potential was studied by pelletizing the filaments again to extrude twice (2×) and three times (3×). The filaments were tensile tested at 10 −4 s −1 , 10 −3 s −1 , and 10 −2 s −1 strain rates. HDPE40 filaments show an increasing trend in modulus and strength with the strain rate. Higher density and modulus were noticed for 2× filaments compared to 1× filaments because of the crushing of some cenospheres in the extrusion cycle. However, 2× and 3× filament densities are nearly the same, showing potential for recycling them. The filaments show better properties than the same materials processed by conventional injection molding. Micro-CT scans show a uniform dispersion of cenospheres in all filaments.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies, such as selective laser melting of polymers enable manufacturing of complex parts without tools and forms. Due to high temperature during processing, a degradation of the used plastic powder occurs. The unmolded material in the building chamber, the so-called partcake, can be removed from the finished component after building and reused for another process. To realize reproducible part properties refreshing of partcake powder is necessary. This paper presents results on the investigations of degradation behavior of polyamide 12 powder during selective laser melting process. The influence of different ambient conditions, e.g. ambient air, nitrogen and vacuum, is investigated in a model experiment. Oven aged polymer powders were analyzed with regard to their process relevant material properties. Considered material properties are phase transition temperatures, melting viscosity or molecular weight. The results of the investigations show, that the influence of high process temperatures on used material can be reduced using other ambient conditions. Process relevant material properties are minor affected by storage under vacuum. In addition to that the influence of different ambient conditions as well as a material pretreatment on the degradation behavior of sls materials, e.g. exclusion of intermolecular located oxygen, is analyzed. To correlate these results of the model experiment with real manufacturing process laser sintering experiments are done. PA12 powder is used for several building processes with refreshing. Produced specimens and resulting partcake powder are analyzed and correlated to the results of model experiment. Correlating effects, regarding process relevant material properties as well as aging influenced mechanical properties of specimens can be detected.},

The many challenges that surround this new manufacturing technology fall into several different categories. The paper addresses one of these categories, the physical mechanisms that control the additive manufacturing process. Physical mechanisms control the effects of processing parameters on microstructures and properties of additively manufactured parts. Some mechanisms might not have been recognized, yet, and for those that are currently known, detailed quantitative predictions have to be established. The physical mechanisms of metal additive manufacturing are firmly grounded in metallurgy, branching into laser physics and the physics of granular materials. Powder bed additive manufacturing is described from the powder storage to post-processing and elements of metallurgy are highlighted that are relevant for the different aspects of the additive manufacturing process. These elements include the surface reactions on powder particles, the heating and melting behavior of the powder bed, solidification, and post-processing. This overview of the different metallurgical aspects to additive manufacturing is intended to help guide research efforts and it will also serve as a snapshot of the current understanding of powder bed additive manufacturing. 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

To ensure the development of additive manufacturing processes it seems important to develop the concept of DFSAM (Design for Sustainable Additive Manufacturing). In fact, one of the objectives of environmental sustainable manufacturing is to minimize the whole flux consumption (electricity, material and fluids) during manufacturing step. To achieve this goal, it is interesting to get a predictive model of consumptions, integrated in the design step, allowing to evaluate the product's environmental impact during the manufacturing step. This paper presents a new methodology for electric, fluids and raw material consumptions assessment for additive manufacturing processes, in particular for a direct metal deposition process. The methodology will help engineers to design parts optimized for additive manufacturing with an environmental point of view.},

abstract = {Polymer recycling is a way to reduce environmental impacts of accumulation of polymeric waste materials. However, low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants mainly to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight-polymers in conventional centralized recycling plants. As the democratization of open-source 3D printers is going forward thanks to initiatives such as FabLab environments, there is a growing interest on how to use this technology to improve the efficiency of use of raw materials. Studies have been proposed in order to recycle waste polymer into open-source 3D printer feedstock. The recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) issued from bottles of used milk jugs through use of an open-source filament fabricator system called RecycleBot has been evaluated. In this study, we propose an evaluation of the mechanical recyclability of Polylactic Acid (PLA), material widely used in the open-source 3D printing context, in order to establish the viability of this recycled material to be used in the open-source 3D printers. The degradation of the material's mechanical and rheological properties after a number of cycles of multiple extrusion and printing processes is evaluated. The characterization of recycled raw materials for open-source 3D printing has implications not only to reduce the environmental impact of polymers waste, but also it will allow us to understand the technical requirements and challenges for development of open-source filament recycle machine/process. The coupling of open-source 3D printers and filament extruders can offer the bases of a new distributed polymer recycling paradigm, which reverses the traditional paradigm of centralizing recycling of polymers where is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. Moreover, this characterization also will allow the exploration of new source of materials and new composite materials for open-source 3D printing, in order to improve the quality of products made by this technology.},

abstract = {The use of thermoplastic composites reinforced with long or continuous fibers underwent an amazing increase due to advantages such as good mechanical performance, high temperature resistance, recyclable and chemical stability when compared with simple thermosetting matrices. These advantages allowed for the replacement of thermosetting systems by composites that led to the discovery of new applications. However, the processing procedure of thermoplastics reinforced with prepregs yarns entails some technological and scientific challenges mainly due to its high viscosity that results in difficulty and complexity in impregnating the reinforcements. Concerning engineering components market requirements, the polyamide thermoplastic matrices reinforced with carbon fibers have a huge demand due to the versatility of the applications where they can be used. This work presents, therefore, the development of a low-cost device that combines the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing technique together with the processing and consolidation of thermoplastic prepregs yarns for manufacturing parts made of polyamide reinforced with carbon fibers without need of post-processing operations. To evaluate the mechanical properties of the polyamide reinforced with carbon fibers, samples were manufactured and three point bending and tensile tests were done. From results it was demonstrated the very high structural strength to both bending and tensile loads of tested material.},

abstract = {3D printing of polymeric materials for various applications has been quickly developed in recent years. In contrast to thermoplastics, 3D printed thermosets, although desirable, are inherently non-recyclable due to their permanently crosslinked networks. As 3D printing is becoming more popular, it is desirable to develop recycling approaches for 3D printed parts in view of increasing polymer wastes. Here, we present a new thermosetting vitrimer epoxy ink and a 3D printing method that can 3D print epoxy into parts with complicated 3D geometries, which later can be recycled into a new ink for the next round of 3D printing. In the first printing cycle, a high-viscous ink is first slightly cured and is then printed at an elevated temperature into complicated 3D structures, followed by an oven cure using a two-step approach. To be recycled, the printed epoxy parts are fully dissolved in an ethylene glycol solvent in a sealed container at a high temperature. The dissolved polymer solution is reused for the next printing cycle using similar printing conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that the ink can be printed four times and still retains very good printability. In addition, the vitrimer epoxy can be used for pressure-free repairs for the 3D printed parts.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature Materials informatics employs techniques, tools, and theories drawn from the emerging fields of data science, internet, computer science and engineering, and digital technologies to the materials science and engineering to accelerate materials, products and manufacturing innovations. Manufacturing is transforming into shorter design cycles, mass customization, on-demand production, and sustainable products. Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a popular example of such a trend. However, the success of this manufacturing transformation is critically dependent on the availability of suitable materials and of data on invertible processing–structure–property–performance life cycle linkages of materials. Experience suggests that the material development cycle, i.e. the time to develop and deploy new material, generally exceeds the product design and development cycle. Hence, there is a need to accelerate materials innovation in order to keep up with product and manufacturing innovations. This is a major challenge considering the hundreds of thousands of materials and processes, and the huge amount of data on microstructure, composition, properties, and functional, environmental, and economic performance of materials. Moreover, the data sharing culture among the materials community is sparse. Materials informatics is key to the necessary transformation in product design and manufacturing. Through the association of material and information sciences, the emerging field of materials informatics proposes to computationally mine and analyze large ensembles of experimental and modeling datasets efficiently and cost effectively and to deliver core materials knowledge in user-friendly ways to the designers of materials and products, and to the manufacturers. This paper reviews the various developments in materials informatics and how it facilitates materials innovation by way of specific examples.},

abstract = {As additive manufacturing (AM) is heading towards mass production and mass customization, the process needs to be environment-friendly and energy-efficient in order to be self-sustainable. Selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) are two processes contributing massively towards plastic additive manufacturing. In SLS, the powders that do not contribute to the mass of products become unusable (after some number of reuse) and finally turn into waste. As high energy is required for production of powders, generation of these wastes impacts environment sustainability. A contrivance needs to be developed to convert these waste powders into high-value products to make the process sustainable. FDM has the largest market share in terms of number of AM systems sold and is the most popular for fabricating low-value products. Its usefulness will be further expanded if inexpensive high-value products could be made through this process. In the present work, waste SLS powder is employed to prepare feedstock for inexpensive high-value FDM products, which demonstrates that SLS refuse could be utilized for mass production of FDM feedstock. If two processes (SLS {\&} FDM) will be connected as proposed here, it will make plastic additive manufacturing energy-efficient, self-sustainable, and will contribute to environment sustainability, in general.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the stab resistance characteristics of a series of planar and articulated laser sintered (LS) samples, in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) Body Armour Standard - Publication 39/07. Design/methodology/approach - A series of LS planar samples were manufactured using an EOS P100 Formiga system, manufactured from 100 per cent virgin or a 50:50 mix of recycled and virgin Nylon (PA2200), ranging in thickness from 1-10 mm. All planar samples were stab tested to the HOSDB knife-resistance (KR) level one impact energy of 24 Joules, using an in-house manufactured HOSDB guided rail drop test impact rig and standardised knives. Penetration through the underside of each sample was measured and recorded. These results were then used to develop an articulated, additive manufactured (AM) scale textile - LS from a 50:50 mix of recycled and virgin PA2200 powder. These samples were then tested using the aforementioned impact rig and stab impact energy. Findings - The research demonstrated that while virgin PA2200 sample required a minimum thickness of 8mm to achieve stab-resistance below the HOSDB maximum penetration limit of 7 mm, this figure can be reduced to 5.6mm when manufacturing LS planar samples from a 50:50 mix of virgin and recycled PA2200. Results from stab testing the articulated samples indicated a successful AM textile-like design, with a maximum knife penetration of 1.6mm - below the 7mm HOSDB limit. Originality/value - The paper describes a unique application of AM technologies for the manufacture of high-performance stab resistant AM textiles. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {In this research work an effort has been made to develop in house feed stock filament wire made up of recycled polymer waste as base matrix with SiC/Al2O3reinforcement for sustainable development. The process starts with collection of waste polymer (high density polyethylene (HDPE) as a case study) from local industry. After manual segregation of contamination from waste polymer, initially rheological and thermal properties like: melt flow index (MFI), melting temperature, decomposition and enthalpy of the base polymer as well as reinforced with ceramic particle in different proportions, were tested. Further based upon thermal properties different proportions of HDPE, SiC and Al2O3were prepared by using mini compounder (twin screw extruder) to ensure uniform dispersion. After this single screw extruder was used to prepare filament wire of uniform diameter for fused deposition modelling (FDM) setup. The filament wire so prepared was tested for its tensile properties by using universal testing machine (UTM) and various mechanical properties like: peak strength, break strength, percentage elongation and peak load etc. were established. Finally scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained to understand the distribution of ceramic particles in filament wire. This study highlights the detailed procedure for managing the polymer waste with novel method by using recycled polymer as rapid tooling. This will enhance the sustainability and also helps to develop low cost, in-house open source FDM setup, rapid tooling (as ceramic particles in filament wire will enhance surface properties).},

AM technology has experienced considerable publicity and growth in the past few years with many successful insertions for non-mission-critical applications. However, to meet the full potential that AM has to offer, especially for flight-critical components (e.g., rotating parts, fracture-critical parts, etc.), qualification and certification efforts are necessary. While development of qualification standards will address some of these needs, this overview outlines some of the other key areas that will need to be considered in the qualification path, including various process-, microstructure-, and fracture-modeling activities in addition to integrating these with lifing activities targeting specific components. Ongoing work in the Advanced Manufacturing and Mechanical Reliability Center at Case Western Reserve University is focusing on fracture and fatigue testing to rapidly assess critical mechanical properties of some titanium alloys before and after post-processing, in addition to conducting nondestructive testing/evaluation using micro-computerized tomography at General Electric. Process mapping studies are being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University while large area microstructure characterization and informatics (EBSD and BSE) analyses are being conducted at Materials Resources LLC to enable future integration of these efforts via an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering approach to AM.

In addition, the use of waste materials in additive manufacturing in the private sector would reduce cost and increase sustainability, providing a high-value output for used plastics. Experimentation is conducted to process polyethylene terephthalate bottles and packaging into filament that can then be used for additive manufacturing methods like fused filament fabrication, without the use of additives or modification to the polymer. The chemistry of different polyethylene terephthalate recycled feedstocks was evaluated and found to be identical, and thus mixed feedstock processing is a suitable approach. Rheological data showed drying of the recycled polyethylene terephthalate led to an increase in the polymer's viscosity. Thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated for filament with different processing conditions, as well as printed and molded specimens. Crystallinity ranged from 12.2 for the water cooled filament, compared to 24.9{\%} for the filament without any active cooling. Tensile results show that the elongation to failure was similar to an injection molded part (3.5{\%}) and tensile strength of 35.1 ± 8 MPa was comparable to commercial polycarbonate-ABS filament, demonstrating the robustness of the material. In addition, three point bending tests showed a similar load at failure for a select long-lead military part printed from the recycled filament compared to parts printed from commercial filament. Thus filament from recycled polyethylene terephthalate has the capability for replacing commercial filament in printing a diverse range of plastic parts.},

It is environmentally unsustainable because, no matter how much recycling is done, not using the resources unless actually needed is always a better path. Three-dimensional printing is currently of great commercial interest as it can be employed to manufacture parts on-demand economically and without the significant cost {\&} environmental downsides, i.e. inventory and waste, associated with traditional manufacturing processes.

We investigate the parameters relating to control of the filament thickness to a variety of different plastic types, which include HDPE and ABS. Following filament generation, parameters were investigated to optimise the print parameters to produce a variety of demonstration models, which test the print resolution. Results suggest that the proposed supply chain can allow for highly repeatable ABS and HDPE filament generation with a diameter of 1.74 ± 0.1mm and 1.65 ± 0.1mm respectively. Ultimately, the production of usable filaments can provide a viable means of consuming waste plastics and reducing the burden of increased landfill.},

abstract = {The development of additive manufacturing (AM) technology provides the possibility of producing complex parts (including internal complex features) that are difficult to manufacture by machining. However, AM technologies also have some limitations, such as low-dimensional accuracy and long production times. Recently, combining additive manufacturing technology with CNC machining is gaining significant attention. This combination not only takes advantages of individual techniques, but also minimizes their disadvantages. In this paper, taking into account consolidated benefits of such technique combination, an alternative remanufacturing strategy is proposed. The strategy allows end-of-life parts (or existing parts) to be reused directly for manufacture of new parts (or final parts) without involving the material recycling stage. In addition, the final part is intended for another product, namely the existing part has a new life and new usage in its life cycle. To achieve the geometry and quality of final part, a sequence of additive, subtractive manufacturing and inspection operations will be generated. For this purpose, additive manufacturing features and machining features are first identified and extracted from the available information of the existing and final parts. This paper particularly focuses on a feature extraction approach, which is developed using the knowledge of additive manufacturing and CNC machining processes, technological requirements, and available resources. The major criteria and constraints have been defined and applied during the feature extraction process. The extracted features and their relationships will be used as the inputs for designing the process planning. Finally, a case study is used to illustrate the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag France},

abstract = {The last four decades produced exponential development in the polymer processing. Radiation processing - initiated also about 40 years ago - yielded a similar pathway of development in the beginning, mostly in the radiation crosslinking of polymers and in the radiation sterilization of polymer products. There are some unexpected results in the developments of the radiation chemistry of polymers utilized well in the polymer processing today. The most dynamical developments of the microelectronics in our days are based on the efficient utilization of radiation-crosslinkable negative photoresist polymers and the radiation degradable positive photoresist polymers. Rapid prototyping and rapid tooling are indispensable methods in the continuously renewing manufacturing technologies of metal and plastic parts for almost all the industrial branches. Polymer composite manufacturing is also profited in many ways from the experiences of radiation technology. Compatibilization through radiation-reactive monomers and oligomers is attacking two great fields of the future polymer processing. Recycling of commingled polymer wastes, and manufacturing new type of alloys of different synthetic as well as natural polymers are requiring well-engineered interface, which can be achieved by radiation processing in a technically feasible and economically viable way. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {3D printing has received lots of attention due to its limitless potential and advantages in comparison to traditional manufacturing processes. This study focuses on the most popular type of home 3D printers, namely fused filament fabrication (FFF) printers, which use plastic filaments as the feedstock. The rather high material cost and large amount of plastic waste generated by FFF 3D printers have driven the need for plastic filaments produced from recycled plastic waste. This study evaluates, in terms of physical characterization, the feasibility of using recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE), one of the most commonly used plastics, as the feedstock for 3D printers, in comparison with the common acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic pellets. In-house extrusion using recycled HDPE pellets and flakes is possible. The diameter consistency and extrusion rate results, along with other physical characterization results, including differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and water absorption, suggest that making filaments from recycled HDPE pellets is a viable option, as the obtained filament has favorable water rejection and comparable extrusion rate and thermal stability. Existing methods for overcoming the warping and adhesion problems in 3D printing with HDPE were also reviewed. In order to increase the market competitiveness of waste-derived filaments, optimization of the extrusion process, studies on the mechanical and aging properties, and development of a standard characterization methodology and database are crucial.},

Similar to the solutions proposed for other forms of ethical manufacturing, it is possible to consider a form of ethical 3-D printer filament distribution being developed. There is a market opportunity for producing this ethical 3-D printer filament, which is addressed in this paper by developing an “ethical product standard” for 3-D filament based upon a combination of existing fair-trade standards and technical and life cycle analysis of recycled filament production and 3-D printing manufacturing. These standards apply to businesses that can enable the economic development of waste pickers and include i) minimum pricing, ii) fair trade premium, iii) labor standards, iv) environmental and technical standards, v) health and safety standards, and vi) social standards including those that cover discrimination, harassment, freedom of association, collective bargaining and discipline.},

The purpose of this study is to find proper utilization of these waste powders by developing filaments from these powders for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. In order to develop filament materials, polyamide powders PA 12 (Nylon material) are mixed with various weight percentages (12.5, 25, 37.5 and 50) of tungsten carbide to enhance mechanical properties. To determine the suitability of powder mixtures for FDM, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Melt flow index (MFI) tests are performed. A single screw extruder is used to process these powder mixtures to form filaments for testing. It is found that the addition of tungsten carbide has increased glass transition temperature, MFI and the strength of resulting polyamide-tungsten carbide composites. Moreover, filaments possess comparable and better strength than existing filaments, which are used to successfully build 3D parts from an FDM system.},

abstract = {Purpose ? This purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the steps and processes behind successfully adapting novel materials, namely virgin glass and recycled glass, to three?dimensional printing (3DP).Design/methodology/approach ? The transition from 3DP ceramic systems to glass systems will be examined in detail, including the necessary modifications to binder systems and printing parameters. The authors present preliminary engineering data on shrinkage, porosity, and density as functions of peak firing temperature, and provide a brief introduction to the complexities faced in realizing an adequate and repeatable firing method for 3D printed glass.Findings ? Shrinkage behavior for the 3D printed recycled glass showed significant anisotropy, especially beyond peak firing temperatures of 730°C. The average shrinkage ratios for the slow? and fast?axes to the Z?axis were 1:1.37 and 1:2.74, respectively. These extreme differences can be attributed to the layer?by?layer production method and binder burn?off. At 760°C, the apparent porosity reached a minimum of 0.36 percent, indicative of asymptotic behavior that approaches a fully dense 3DP glass specimen. At low firing temperatures, the bulk density was similar to water, but increased to a maximum of 2.41?g/cm3. This indicates that 3DP recycled glass can behave similarly to common glass with accepted published bulk densities ranging from 2.4?2.8?g/cm3.Research limitations/implications ? Heating schedule analysis and optimization may reduce geometric variations, therefore, the firing method should be investigated in greater depth.Originality/value ? This paper provides a guide to successfully adopting glass to commercially available 3DP hardware. This research has also enabled rapid prototyping of recycled glass, a monumental step towards a sustainable future for 3DP.},

However the various polymer, metallic and composite feedstocks used within additive manufacturing are mainly derived from energy consuming, inefficient methods, often originating from non-sustainable sources. This work explores the mechanical properties of additively manufactured composite structures fabricated from recycled sustainable wood waste with the aim of enhancing mechanical properties through glass fibre reinforcement. In the first instance, samples were formed by pouring formulation of wood waste (wood flour) and thermosetting binder (urea formaldehyde), with and without glass fibres, into a mould. The same formulations were used to additively manufacture samples via a layered deposition technique. Samples manufactured using each technique were cured and subsequently tested for their mechanical properties. Additively manufactured samples had superior mechanical properties, with up to 73{\%} increase in tensile strength compared to moulded composites due to a densification of feedstock/paste and fibre in-situ directional alignment.},
