## Competences for Social Innovation Lab Teams


Social innovation labs as collaborative intermediary organisations require skilled labour to manage all the different tasks around the work of a lab. 

Ideally, people working in the lab have work experience in several societal sectors, or at least the mix of team members yields work experience in different sectors (public administration, private, not-for-profit etc.) and different policy fields (education, labour, health etc.). 
This way, the lab- secretariat itself involves practitioners with diverse perspectives on societal challenges. 
Furthermore, this mix of lab-secretariat team members generates a multitude of key competencies that effective lab-processes rely on (Civic systems lab 2016; BMUB 2016; Puttick 2014a, Schneidewind 2013):
