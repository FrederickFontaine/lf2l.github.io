# Context

Social innovation labs as collaborative intermediary organisations require skilled labour to manage all the different tasks around the work of a lab. 

Ideally, people working in the lab have work experience in several societal sectors, or at least the mix of team members yields work experience in different sectors (public administration, private, not-for-profit etc.) and different policy fields (education, labour, health etc.). 
This way, the lab- secretariat itself involves practitioners with diverse perspectives on societal challenges. 
Furthermore, this mix of lab-secretariat team members generates a multitude of key competencies that effective lab-processes rely on (Civic systems lab 2016; BMUB 2016; Puttick 2014a, Schneidewind 2013):


- Competency in **project management** (e.g. competency for planning and realising innovative projects; meeting legal requirements as well as financial literacy, contracts and space use agreements)

- Competency of **moderation** (e.g. emerging strategy design for incorporating new knowledge and steering the overall project in real time, able to help draw collective insight, encouraging people to share ideas and participate; pedagogy expertise and methods to ensure progression of team and participants)

- Competency for **mediation** (conflict resolution) 

- Competency for **networking** (being able to build connections and relationships with local organisations and businesses, funding bodies, community groups; ability to make deliberate and meaningful introductions between people)

- Competency for **participation** (detailed knowledge of project models and comparison with current participation approaches, inviting people to join, introducing them to the project, welcoming and inductions)

- Competency for **communication** (e.g. competency for empathy and change of perspective, competency for use of media; clear, positive, conversational style for newsletters and social media)

- Competency for **self-organisation** (e.g. confidence and self-esteem; competency for ambiguity and frustration tolerance)

- **Intercultural** competence (expertise on ways to ensure inclusivity across cultures, ages, economic backgrounds, physical locations)

- Competency for **evaluation** (designing what data to capture to inform strategy and evidence outcomes)

- Competency in **research methods and interdisciplinary work** (e.g. competency for critical thinking, data analytics, social research, anthropology)

- Competency in **design methods and creative thinking** (e.g. ability to combine ideas and knowledge in novel ways, design thinking, theory of change planning)

- Competency in **information and telecommunication techniques** (e.g. technology development and coding)

- Competency in **entrepreneurial thinking** (e.g. venture experience, project incubation process such as recombining assets and opportunities)

- Competency for **systemic thinking** (e.g. handling of complexity, anticipatory thinking, transformative literacy)
