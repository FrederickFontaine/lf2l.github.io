Working with the LF2L, you benefit from the experience of the ERPI laboratory, which for more than thirty-five years has been conducting research in the transformation of organisations and territories through innovative processes. Its activities focus on two research themes: the assessment of acceptability in the upstream stages of innovation (methodologies and technologies) and the identification, modelling, integration and capitalisation of knowledge and skills in the upstream stages of innovative projects.

In addition, in twenty years, the engineering school of Innovation **ENSGSI** associated with the **ERPI laboratory**,  has demonstrated its ability to teach and disseminate tools, methods and skills conducive to the emergence of innovation.
