# Makers
The digital communication revolution is behind us. We are now living the revolution of Personal Manufacturing or DIY.

To open up to as many people as possible, the **Lorraine Fab Living LabÂ®** makes its premises and resources available every Thursday evening to the association **NYBI**.

The University of Lorraine thus enables all those who want to manufacture by themselves, discover new technologies, learn to use them, to benefit from the equipment and spaces resulting from research.

The NYBI welcomes all audiences every Thursday, from 7pm to midnight, to discover the world of FabLabs.
People interested in joining the association are welcome in the early evening to discover the places and members.
For the members of the association the LF2L is available until midnight.
