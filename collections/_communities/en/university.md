## University

The Lorraine Fab Living Lab速 is a research and experimentation platform managed by the ERPI laboratory. Through its strong links with ENSGSI, the platform is also a pedagogical support for active teaching in certain curricula. Whether through the use of modeling and prototyping devices or by facilitating collaborative work such as for ingEXys workshops.

LF2L速 also supports a variety of research projects of the ERPI and its partners. The laboratory's thirty permanent researchers work on, among other things, the capacity of SMEs to innovate, the recycling of raw materials for additive manufacturing, the consideration and involvement of users in projects (Living lab), evaluation by use, collaborative methodologies for smart-city, immersive devices, creativity, innovation spaces.

LF2L速 thus hosts the work of the PRINCIP Research Chair (accredited by the Fund for Innovation in Industry) dedicated to SMEs, and the REVES Collaborative Chair (Ecological Renaissance of Cities), supported by ENEDIS, EDF, the Greater Nancy Metropolitan Area, the CCPHVA, deploying the Smart Cities concept to propose solutions to the new societal challenges faced by cities and territories.
