### Fab Living lab approach on Smart meters and smart grids

Linky by Makers (LbM) project explores the development of a user-driven innovation supporting French public electricity distribution network.

LbM is a citizen research program involving academics, engineers from ENEDIS, the French electricity distributor, students and citizens as “makers”. Indeed, our team also involves a French FabLabs network, asked to communities of makers, of different French FL, to create new products and services based on the information and new functionalities of the smart meter.
